# BIDS Access controls

This org controls access to JupyterHubs managed by the Berkeley Institute for Data Science.

Access is controlled by team memberships on this organization.

To grant a user access to the [AI Futures Lab demo Hub]([https](https://aifutureslab-hub.bids.berkeley.edu), add them to the [aifutures-hub-users](https://github.com/orgs/bids-access/teams/aifutures-hub-users) team.
